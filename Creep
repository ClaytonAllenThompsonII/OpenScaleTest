Calibration Suggestions
Creep is the change in load cell signal occurring with time while under constant load and with all environmental conditions and other variables also remaining constant. 
Load cells tend to creep meaning they will change their output slightly over time when a weight is left on the scale for long (30+ minutes) periods of time. 
To calibrate for something such as a bee hive that will be permanently left on a scale:

Place everything on the scale that will be the zero state (the hive plus any static ballast)
Leave the scale for 30+ minutes
Tare the scale with these weights
Place two calibration weights onto the scale
Leave the scale for 30+ minutes
Calibrate the scale to this combined weight
Remove one of the calibration weights and verify scale output
More information about load cells and creep can be found here. 

Creep is also load cell specific. 
You will find a section on creep in the data sheet for your specific load cell. 
This calibration method may need to be repeated every season with changing temperatures and humidity.
